                                I revised the categories of items stored by generation based on similarity of categories, their use, and areas of which they would be stored at home. My revised breakdown of items stored included the following: A new category titled &ldquo;Houseware&rdquo;
                                was created where I combined the categories of &ldquo;Household supplies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kitchenware (plates, pots, pans, utensils)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Towels/Blankets/Linens.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Furniture&rdquo; category was
                                revised so that it also included both indoor but also &ldquo;Outdoor/seasonal furniture.&rdquo; A new category titled &ldquo;Hobby related objects&rdquo; was created which encompassed &ldquo;Collectibles/Objects related
                                to hobbies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tools.&rdquo; &ldquo;Personal items&rdquo; was revised to include &ldquo;Pictures/Photos/Paintings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Family records (bank statements, tax filings).&rdquo; &ldquo;Holiday seasonal
                                items&rdquo; include Christmas, Halloween, or Thanksgiving decorations &ldquo;Other&rdquo; includes &ldquo;Non-perishable food&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vehicles (cars, boats).&rdquo;

                                    Considering self-storage is used at a mass scale, using another large ubiquitous retailer that many American used seemed most appropriate for price estimations. Taking the average breakdown of items stored and using big box brands like IKEA and Michaels
                                    for estimated pricing, below is how are the calculations of what an average storage unit is worth.

                    <p style="font-weight:normal;" align="left"> <strong>Sources:</strong> Self-Storage Industry data from the 2018 Storage & Warehouse Leasing in the US IBIS world research. Mcdonald&rsquo;s square footage is based on 2016 estimates of average floor space. For and Starbucks for
                        square footage, average floor space from 2014 (https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2014/three-starbucks-stores-that-inspire-one-of-the-most-creative-people-in-busi/) and number of locations from 2018 were used. Survey data is
                        from the 2017 Self-Storage Demand Study. U.S. Consumption data from: https://data.worldbank.org. * Household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including
                        durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments
                        to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
